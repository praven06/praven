      What is web development? A web developer's job is to create websites. 
      While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually appealing <br>
      and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the 
      website's performance and capacity. Types of web developers Web developers <br>
      usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end 
      developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as <br>
      webmasters. Let's take a closer look at each of these roles. Back-end web 
      developers create the website's structure, write code, and verify the code <br>
      works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for 
      others who need to manage a website's content. Front-end web developers <br>
      work on the visual part of the websiteâ€”the pages visitors see and interact 
      with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout <br>
      of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance 
      the site
